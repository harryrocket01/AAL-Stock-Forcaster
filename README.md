# Data Acquisition and Processing Systems (DAPS) (ELEC0136)

Welcome to the final assignment of the _Data Acquisition and Processing Systems_ (DAPS) course ELEC0136 at UCL.

This repository contains the scaffolding to submit your code.
Your code must be in plain Python files and you cannot use Jupyter notebooks to solve the assignment.

**We will consider only code written on the `main` branch**, so please work only on that branch.

Please, follow the instructions in the *Submission* section of the assignment document to submit your code.

# Notes + Overveiw of code structure.

This is my final submission for my coursework for ELEC0136.

The main file is set up and exectutes each section of code in order of the tasks, as in line with the document.

An enviroment file has been included. Along with a read mean. Python version is 3.11.7

The majority of the code is found within .\DAPs_Code. All graphics for each task are found within .\DAPs_Code\Task_#\Graphics.

A copy of the API is included, but not run, as inline with Provided document. Please refer to report appendix to see it working, or host it on a flask dev.

Tensorflow will throw errors. I tried to hide them all, but some still may appear.

Take note that some of the API may not work, as many of them have limits or sometimes gets blocked by anti spoofing measures if used too much by one IP (such as google trends). The cloud database contains all of the data needed, hence in the case where it doesnt work, everything in the code will still work fine.

The code base was built on Window 10, on a XPS 15 (Intel 10th gen processor), hence other systems may have varying performance.

Enjoy the marking of the Many-many of lines of code, and I apologise in advance for any dumb spelling mistakes in variable names :)
